    -   Example Use Case


##  **Purpose**
My accountant, who is very very coincidentally also my father, works primarily in Excel.

Keeping track of invoices and bookkeeping in a single Excel file worked fine at first,
but as the file grew larger, it started causing problems.
It takes too long to load and sometimes doesn't even open.
Which makes the whole process slow and frustrating.

I was asked if it is possible to create something similair, but faster and more reliable.

This app will be built to solve that problem. It will be designed to make managing invoices easier, quicker and less error-prone.
Whether it's creating a new invoice or continuing where you left off, or make changes later, the app will keep everything organized and easy to access.

While the app is based on my accountant's way of working, it's flexible enough that others could use it for their own bookkeeping. In the future, I hope to add more features that users wish for while keeping the original idea intact.

## **Key Features**
Before we process to the Key Features of this application, please not that this is, and will problebly forever be in development. I will try my best to add more features according to the wishes of users.


The following Features will be available in the applicatoin:

#### Invoices Creation
Create invoices quickly and easily for selected companies. The app takes the functionality of the existing Excel file workflow but with an UI that adds more ease of use.

#### Edit and Save
Make changes to an invoice as needed and save them either locally or in the cloud.
This ensures that your data is always secure and accessible when required.

#### Link invoices
If you have a lot of clients, it can get annoying too properly find the right invoice you're looking for.
The application will link the created invoice to the person or company it is meant for, while also linking it to the debitor that it meant to be send by.

#### User-Focused Simplicity
The app prioritizes simplicity and ease of use. It's tailored specifically to meet the needs of the current workflow without unnecessary complexity.






    

#### What are the standout features of the application? 
zzInvoice enables users to quickly create, edit, delete and save invoices for a selected company.
Users can save invoices locally or in the cloud for backup purposes.


While the application draws inspiratoin from an Excel-based workflow,
it expands upon it to provide faster performance, greater scalability and improved usability.

However, this becomes a problem for any country that does not have a similair tax system to european countries.


#### Are there unique functionalities what set this application apart from others? 
The unique aspect of this application is its flexibility and customization, designed specifically around the accountant's preferences and workflow.
This ensuses a tailored solution that adapts to individual needs.

#### What it does 
Lets users design or choose templates that align with their brand
For example, adding logo, adjusting the theme, multiple layouts

#### Why it's necesasary 
Everyone has their own preferences, with this feature I want to allow all users to try and make their own templates.
Or, they can hire a developer with HTML and CSS expierence to create a template that fits perfectly with the theme of the company.
